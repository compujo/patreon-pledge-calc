# Deprecation notice
Patreon has changed their minds and decided not to roll out the planned changes for now. More details here: https://blog.patreon.com/not-rolling-out-fees-change/

Should there be further changes to the payment scheme I may update this userscript, but for now it should be disabled.

# Patreon Pledge Predictor
Calculates the new patreon pledge amount

# Install
Download [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) and then open the [raw userscript file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/compujosh/patreon-pledge-calc/master/patreon_pledge_predictor.user.js) and hit install.

Note: There is currently a bug preventing Greasemonkey from installing scripts from GitHub. Chrome and Tampermonkey are recommended for now. Firefox users can install from [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/36124-patreon-pledge-predictor)

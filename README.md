# Install
Download [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) and then open the [raw userscript file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/compujosh/patreon-pledge-calc/master/patreon_pledge_predictor.user.js) and hit install.

Note: There is currently a bug preventing Greasemonkey from installing scripts from GitHub. Chrome and Tampermonkey are recommended for now.
